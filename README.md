# SFT Learning Algorithm
I aim to learn models of sanitizers (by using learning algorithms) so that I can reason about the correctness of sanitizers.
This repository contains implementations for:
* SFA learning algorithm
* SFT learning algorithm

The code in this repository is based on symbolicautomata (https://github.com/lorisdanto/symbolicautomata), which is a library for automata. All files that have been modified contain a short notice at the top of the file to indicate that it has been modified. All newly added files contain a notice that indicates that it has been added by me.
