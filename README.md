# SFT Learning Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of a *SFT learning algorithm* (in the making).
It also contains an implementation for an *SFA learning algorithm*.
Using these learning algorithms, I aim to learn models of sanitizers so that I can reason about the correctness of these sanitizers.

The code in this repository is based on symbolicautomata (https://github.com/lorisdanto/symbolicautomata), which is a library for automata. All files that have been modified contain a short notice at the top of the file to indicate that it has been modified. All newly added files contain a notice that indicates that it has been added by me.
